# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone. 

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/project-name.git

Make your change. Make sure to test your changes.

Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests or test your changes.
* Follow our style guide.
* Write a [good commit message][commit].
* Explain your changes.
